## The Ten Starting Steps

### Preliminaries

-  1: Start with documents
-  2: Simple R chunks within documents
-  3: Atomic types 
-  4: Assignment & naming (trivial)
-  5: Vectors
-  6: Packages

### Data Science

-  7: Data frames
-  8: Wrangling
-  9: Graphics
- 10: Programming constructs

### At this point ...

You don't know everything about R, but enough to read other people's examples and documentation in `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, and modify the examples to your own purpose.
